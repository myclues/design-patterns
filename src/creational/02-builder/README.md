# Builder

Builders let you start with a baseline object template, gradually set options that you want to customize it with, and confirm ("build") the final output.

## Typical Examples

- Query builders

## Pizza Scenario

&Pizza, Mod Pizza, etc. all let me start with a base, select toppings, and finally send it through the toaster oven to "build" it.  Time to load up on hot honey!
