# Factory

Factories are very basic patterns for reliably creating the same "thing" again and again with no frills or variations.  Think preset options.

## Typical Examples

- Mock testing data


## Pizza Scenario

Yum!  Pizza!  I'm not a great cook though, so I just get the frozen pizzas from the store.  I can't customize my toppings so all I get is the premade kind.
